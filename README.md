# Hi, I’m Krrish Mahar 👋

I'm a **3rd-year Computer Engineering student** passionate about DevOps, automation and cloud infrastructure. I’m actively learning and applying technologies like Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, AWS, and CI/CD pipelines, and I’m seeking remote internships or roles in DevOps.

## About Me

- 🎓 **Background:** 3rd-year B.Tech in Computer Engineering, with a strong interest in software development, cloud computing, and infrastructure automation.  
- 🌱 **DevOps Focus:** I enjoy building reliable CI/CD pipelines (with Jenkins and GitHub Actions) and designing scalable architectures on AWS (EC2, RDS, S3).  
- 🤖 **Machine Learning:** I also have a keen interest in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). I’ve studied the basics of neural networks (ANN, CNN), SVMs, and linear regression.  
- 🚀 **About Me:** I’m a proactive learner who loves sharing knowledge (e.g. on my [Medium blog](https://medium.com/@krrishmahar5)). I believe in **continuous improvement** and always look for opportunities to automate and optimize.

## Key DevOps Projects
